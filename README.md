<h2>ðŸš’ A New Chapter</h2>

<p> 
I have been programming since 2017, building projects out of curiosity, passion, and a desire to solve real problems. After a lot of reflection, I decided to step away from the tech industry - at least for now - to explore a different path, one where I can help people more directly.

The current state of the IT job market, especially at the junior level, makes it difficult to fully demonstrate your skills. Many hiring processes focus more on checklists than on real potential, which also influenced my decision.

Today, I serve in the Polish State Fire Service (PSP) - a role that gives me a strong sense of purpose and connection to the real world.

That said, this is a test - not a goodbye. Programming is still a big part of who I am. I continue to develop personal projects and explore new technologies in my free time. Who knows - maybe one day Iâ€™ll find a way to combine tech and emergency services.

You probably wonâ€™t see much activity from me here anytime soon. If I do work on something, itâ€™ll most likely show up on my GitLab: [https://gitlab.emef.dev/emef](https://gitlab.emef.dev/emef).
